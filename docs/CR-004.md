# Change Request (CR) – FocusForge

**CR ID:** CR-004  
**Submission Date:** 2025-12-29  
**Requester:** Amanuel Addisu  
**Priority:** [ ] High   [ ] Medium   [x] Low  

### 1. Description of Proposed Change
Add a dark/light mode toggle switch to the application header or settings.

### 2. Reason for Change
The application already supports dark mode via Tailwind's dark class, but users have no way to manually switch between light and dark themes. Adding a toggle would:
- Improve accessibility
- Give users control over appearance
- Enhance overall user experience

### 3. Impacted Configuration Items
- FF-Code-DashboardPage-v1.0.jsx (add toggle UI)
- FF-Code-GoalCreatePage-v1.0.jsx (add toggle UI)
- FF-Code-App-v1.0.jsx (possible global state for theme)
- New file: FF-Code-ThemeToggle-v1.0.jsx (component)

### 4. Proposed Solution
- Create a reusable ThemeToggle component (sun/moon icon switch)
- Use localStorage to persist user preference
- Apply 'dark' class to <html> element based on preference
- Add toggle to header on Dashboard and GoalCreate pages

### 5. Impact Analysis
- **Technical Impact:** Moderate — requires state management, DOM manipulation, and new component. May affect existing dark mode behavior.
- **Schedule Impact:** Medium – adds complexity near deadline
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium – potential for theme flickering or style conflicts

### 6. Change Control Board (CCB) Decision
**Decision:** [ ] Approved   [x] Rejected   [ ] Deferred  
**Decision Date:** 2025-12-29  
**CCB Members:**  
- Amanuel Firew – SCM Manager  
- Amanuel Fisseha – Project Leader  
**Comments / Conditions:**

Additional changes (including dark/light mode toggle) are out of scope and risk impacting schedule near submission deadline.
