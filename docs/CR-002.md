# Change Request (CR) – FocusForge

**CR ID:** CR-002  
**Submission Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Requester:** Amanuel Wonde  
**Priority:** [ ] High   [x] Medium   [ ] Low  

### 1. Description of Proposed Change
Add a streak counter on the dashboard showing consecutive days of milestone completion.

### 2. Reason for Change
FocusForge emphasizes focus and consistency. A streak counter will:
- Motivate users to engage daily
- Provide positive feedback
- Strengthen the motivational core of the application

This enhancement improves user experience and aligns with the project theme.

### 3. Impacted Configuration Items
- FF-Code-Goal-v1.0.js (model – add streak and lastActivityDate fields)
- FF-Code-goalController-v1.0.js (updateMilestone logic to maintain streak)
- FF-Code-DashboardPage-v1.0.jsx (display streak count)

### 4. Proposed Solution
- Add to Goal schema:
  - streak: { type: Number, default: 0 }
  - lastActivityDate: { type: Date }
- In updateMilestone controller:
  - When a milestone is marked done:
    - Normalize current date and lastActivityDate to day only (ignore time)
    - If lastActivityDate was yesterday → streak += 1
    - If same day → no change to streak
    - Else → streak = 1
    - Update lastActivityDate to today
- Display on dashboard: "{streak} day streak" near progress circle

### 5. Impact Analysis
- **Technical Impact:** Small schema update + logic in controller. Backward compatible (old goals have streak 0).
- **Schedule Impact:** None
- **Risk Assessment:** Low

### 6. Change Control Board (CCB) Decision
