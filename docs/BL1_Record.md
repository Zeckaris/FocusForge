# Baseline Record – BL1

**Project:** FocusForge – One Goal, One Focus  
**Baseline Identifier:** BL1  
**Git Tag:** BL1  
**Date Established:** December 21, 2025  
**SCM Manager (Approver):** Amanuel Firew  
**Project Leader:** Amanuel Fisseha

### Purpose
This baseline captures the initial controlled configuration of the FocusForge project before any software development begins. It includes the repository structure, finalized Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP), Configuration Item (CI) Register, and all supporting change control documentation, as required by the mini-project assignment (Deliverable 5 – Baseline 1).

### Scope and Contents
The following Configuration Items are placed under formal configuration control in this baseline:

| CI Name                             | Version | Category    | Status    |
|-------------------------------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| FF-Doc-SCMP-v1.0                    | 1.0     | Document    | Approved  |
| FF-Doc-CI_Register-v1.0             | 1.0     | Document    | Approved  |
| FF-Doc-CR_Template-v1.0             | 1.0     | Document    | Approved  |
| FF-Doc-Change_Log-v1.0              | 1.0     | Document    | Draft     |
| FF-Doc-BL1_Record-v1.0              | 1.0     | Document    | Approved  |
| README.md                           | 1.0     | Document    | Approved  |
| LICENSE                             | 1.0     | Legal       | Approved  |

**Repository Structure Established:**  
/docs, /src/client, /src/server, /tests, /releases

### Baseline Acceptance Criteria Met
- All required SCM planning documents are complete and approved
- Configuration Item identification and naming conventions are defined
- Change control infrastructure (CR template and log) is in place
- No source code development has started

### Notes
All subsequent work shall be performed on dedicated feature branches. Any modification to configuration items within this baseline requires a formal Change Request evaluated by the Change Control Board.

This baseline fully satisfies the assignment requirement:  
"Baseline 1: Repository setup + initial documents + CI list."
