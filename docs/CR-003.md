# Change Request (CR) – FocusForge

**CR ID:** CR-003  
**Submission Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Requester:** Amanuel Million  
**Priority:** [x] High   [ ] Medium   [ ] Low  

### 1. Description of Proposed Change
When there is no active goal (e.g., after completing all milestones), display a prominent "Start New Goal" button/link on the dashboard instead of forcing a redirect.

### 2. Reason for Change
Current behavior: After completing a goal, the active goal section disappears, and the user is left on the dashboard with only achievements visible. There is no clear way to start a new goal without logging out and back in.

This creates a poor user experience — the app feels "stuck." Adding a visible button/link allows users to stay on the dashboard (view achievements) while providing an obvious next action.

### 3. Impacted Configuration Items
- FF-Code-DashboardPage-v1.0.jsx (will be updated to add conditional "Start New Goal" button/link)

### 4. Proposed Solution
- In DashboardPage.jsx:
  - When activeGoal is null (after completion or no goal):
    - Show a centered section with congratulatory text (e.g., "Great work on your achievements!")
    - Add a large, styled "Start New Goal" button/link that navigates to /create-goal

### 5. Impact Analysis
- **Technical Impact:** Very minor — conditional UI addition in DashboardPage.jsx. No backend or other file changes.
- **Schedule Impact:** None
- **Risk Assessment:** Low – purely presentational and navigation improvement

### 6. Change Control Board (CCB) Decision
**Decision:** [x] Approved   [ ] Rejected   [ ] Deferred  
**Decision Date:** 2025-12-29  
**CCB Members:**

**Comments / Conditions:** Approved for immediate implementation on dedicated branch `change/cr-003`.

### 7. Implementation and Verification
**Assigned Contributor:** Amanuel Million  
**Implementation Branch:** change/cr-003

  - Complete all milestones → confetti plays → active goal disappears  
  - "Start New Goal" button appears on dashboard  
  - Click button → navigates to /create-goal  
  - User can stay on dashboard to view achievements first
