# Change Request (CR) – FocusForge

**CR ID:** CR-001  
**Submission Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Requester:** Ammar Mohammed  
**Priority:** [x] High   [ ] Medium   [ ] Low  

### 1. Description of Proposed Change
Add a Logout button visible on protected pages (Dashboard and Goal Create) after successful login.

### 2. Reason for Change
Currently, there is no way for users to log out of the application. Adding a logout function will:
- Clear the JWT token from localStorage
- Improve security and user control
- Provide a complete authentication flow (login + logout)

This is an essential enhancement for the working system.

### 3. Impacted Configuration Items
- FF-Code-useAuth-v1.0.js (will be updated)
- FF-Code-DashboardPage-v1.0.jsx (will be updated)
- FF-Code-GoalCreatePage-v1.0.jsx (will be updated)

### 4. Proposed Solution
- Extend the `useAuth` hook with a `logout` function that:
  - Removes `token` from localStorage
  - Shows success message
  - Redirects to login page
- Add a visible "Logout" button (top-right corner) on DashboardPage and GoalCreatePage
- Use existing navigation and daisyUI styling for consistency

### 5. Impact Analysis
- **Technical Impact:** Minor modifications to existing files. No breaking changes or new dependencies.
- **Schedule Impact:** None – small and straightforward implementation
- **Risk Assessment:** Low – only affects client-side authentication state
